## Part 1

Link has a bunch of ingredients and he wants to experiment and see what kinds of meals he can make with them. He knows for sure that when he cooks `Hylian Rice` with a `Big Hearty Truffle` that he gets `Mushroom Rice Balls`, but for some reason heâ€™s not seeing it in his mealsâ€¦

On his travels, he found some recipes on the walls of the stables heâ€™s visited:

- `Hateno Cheese` and a `Bird Egg` will make a `Cheesy Omlette`
- `Tabantha Wheat` and `Hateno Cheese` will make a `Cheesy Hylian Pizza`
- `Raw Prime Meat` and `Hylian Rice` will make `Prime Meat and Rice Bowl`

## Part 2

Link found some more materials in the Tabantha Frontier, he also stopped in Rito village to buy a few items. Add the following items to his materials array:

`'Goat Butter', 'Fresh Milk', 'Cane Sugar', 'Raw Bird Thigh'`

Link has also learned a few new recipes:

- `Fresh Milk`, `Cane Sugar`, and a `Bird Egg` will make `Egg Pudding`
- `Tabantha Wheat`, `Cane Sugar`, `Goat Butter`, and a `Bird Egg` will make an `Egg Tart`
- `Hylian Rice`, `Raw Prime Meat`, and a `Bird Egg` will make `Chicken Egg Fried Rice`
- `Hylian Rice`, `Goat Butter`, a `Bird Egg` and a `Raw Bird Thigh` will make `Poultry Pilaf`

Notice how these recipes require more than one ingredient. Some require three, some require four, and the previous recipes still only require two. Discuss with your team how you can update the existing function. You may need to practice your googling skills ðŸ˜‰

### Questions to ask yourselves:

- What should the parameter(s) for the cook function be to account for any number of ingredients?
- How do we pass in the specific ingredients to the function?
- How can we check for the specific ingredients?
